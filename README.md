# HTML CSS Code Refactor

* Accessibility is essential for all developers and organizations that want to create high quality web sites and tools, and it is imperative to not exclude people from using their services and products. 
As such all required semantic elements were added to make it more accessible and optimized for search engines.

## What was done :

* As requested, semantic elements were added to HTML file to comply with accessibility requirements. Added elements like header, main, sections, nav, aside and a footer. 
* All images were added alt attributes with description of images
* Div class "hero" was added a role presentation element declaring that it was just presentational 
* CSS file was also consolidated in few instances, same code on multiple selectors 
* Also added explanatory comments to CSS.
